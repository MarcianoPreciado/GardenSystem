	This is where the source code uploaded on the microcontroller is located. The microcontroller (MCU) acts as a slave to the microprocessor. They interface through serial communication.
	The MCU carries out all of the automation processes related to the maintenance of the plants within the system, ie. lights, watering. When there is a system change, in the case that a cell needs to be shut down, or a plant is added/removed, the MCU will receive an update from the microcontroller and the MCU will act accordingly.
